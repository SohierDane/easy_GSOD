# easy_GSOD
Provides tools for downloading the entire GSOD corpus and unpacking
the data into a machine readable format. 

NOAA's [Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod) is a rich weather dataset providing coverage stretching back several decades. However, because the data has been provided for so long the file formats and file structures are optimized for saving space rather than productive use. easy_GSOD makes it easy to access this dataset with modern tools.
