# easy_GSOD
Provides tools for downloading the entire GSOD corpus and unpacking
the data into a machine readable format. 

NOAA's [Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod) is a rich weather dataset providing coverage stretching back several decades. However, because the data has been provided for so long the file formats and file structures are optimized for saving space rather than productive use. easy_GSOD makes bulk downloads and data translations fast so you can focus on using the data rather than getting to it.
